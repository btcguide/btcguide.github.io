#### Verify Your Firmware Before Installing
Confirm that the sha256 hash digest of the file you downloaded matches what is expected:

Linux:
```
$ shasum -a 256 V1.4.0-BTC_Only.zip 
6956715f43893da00f41ff6e3da5403c908e853f35ad85b80ab75af59b3f1faf  V1.4.0-BTC_Only.zip
```
Windows:
```
> certutil -hashfile V1.4.0-BTC_Only.zip sha256
SHA256 hash of V1.4.0-BTC_Only.zip:
6956715f43893da00f41ff6e3da5403c908e853f35ad85b80ab75af59b3f1faf
CertUtil: -hashfile command completed successfully.
```

(The above hashes are accurate for `v1.4.0` but will become stale for future releases. Calculate the hash digest of the new file and confirm that it matches what's published by the company.)
