title: Setup Hardware Wallet Overview
---

#### Overview
We're going to configure a `2-of-3` multisignature scheme, meaning you will have 3 keys, and a quorum of 2 will be required to send funds
(or safely verify an address to receive funds on).

The three wallets / keys will be:

1. A "paper wallet" key intended only for backup/recovery purposes - To simplify setup (and reduce upfront costs associated with hardware purchases), this key will be generated on your computer. By design this key is only for backup/recovery, and therefore will hopefully never be needed.
2. A key generated by your Cobo Vault hardware wallet
3. A key generated by your Coldcard hardware wallet

While there are a lot of steps here, you only ever need to do them once.
After setup is complete, you will be able to generate (nearly) infinite addresses and sign (nearly) infinite transactions.

[TODO]: auto-gen this TOC somehow?
