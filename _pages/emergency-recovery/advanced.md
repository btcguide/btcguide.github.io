## Option B - Electrum Software Wallet

#### Use an Airgap Machine
Tails strongly recommended.

Also, in Step 5 on the previous page, instead of saving the PBST to file, you can take a picture of the Specter's txn QR code with your phone. Then inside Electrum, use `Tools` > `Load transaction from QR code` and open up the QR code picture on your phone. Hold your phone up to your webcam so Electrum can scan it. You may need to pinch and zoom and try different distances so that the QR can be read cleanly. The QR code is a better method for airgap since we wont have to use any USB or SD cards to move the PBST file around to gather signatures.

#### Verify Validity of Electrum Software
